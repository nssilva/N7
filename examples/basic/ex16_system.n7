' 'system' works as in n6, but can also be used in an expression to capture the
' output instead of sending it to stdout.

' This probably doesn't work on Linux.
result = system("dir /b /a-d")
pln "Press enter to see the captured result!"
a = rln()
pln result

pln "Press enter to see it again!"
a = rln()
system "dir /b /a-d"

pln
pln "Press enter to exit"
tmp = rln()
